## Introduction

**LearnForge** is an AI-powered educational backend that designs and orchestrates deeply personalized learning experiences. Built with the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and powered by a **multi-agent architecture**, LearnForge adapts to each learner's goals, existing knowledge, and preferred depth of understanding.

It intelligently generates **missions**, **content**, and **evaluations** — guiding users through an adaptive journey toward true mastery.

## Core Principles

* **Personalization** – Learning paths are dynamically tailored to the learner's objectives, desired depth, and prior experience.
* **Byte-Sized Learning** – Every concept is delivered as a focused, digestible *mission* composed of smaller actionable *steps*.
* **Adaptive Reinforcement** – Continuous assessments and feedback ensure concept mastery through reinforcement and iteration.
* **Conversational Interface** – Learners interact naturally with AI agents that understand, guide, and support their progress.

## Prerequisites

* Docker & Docker Compose
* Google Cloud SDK (for deployment)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rashikakarki/learnforge-backend.git
cd learnforge-backend

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your configuration

# Start the application
make up
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8080

## Available Commands

### Development

```bash
make up              # Start development server
make down            # Stop server
make logs            # View logs
make restart         # Restart server
make shell           # Open container shell
```

### Testing & Code Quality

```bash
make test            # Run all tests
make lint            # Run linters (ruff, black, isort)
make format          # Format code
make docker-test     # Test Docker build locally
```

### Deployment

```bash
make deploy          # Deploy to Google Cloud Run
```

> **Note**: Deployment requires `.env` file with GCP configuration and proper Google Cloud service account credentials.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Workflows

- **CI** - Runs on all branches and PRs
  - ✅ Linting (ruff, black, isort)
  - ✅ Unit tests (pytest)

- **CD** - Deploys on push to `main`
  - 🚀 Auto-deploy to Cloud Run

### Setup GitHub Deployment

1. Add GitHub secrets:
   - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
   - `ALLOW_ORIGINS`
   - `GCP_SA_KEY`

2. Push to `main` to deploy
